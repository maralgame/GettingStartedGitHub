-- Hands-on Lab: Built-in functions
-- Aggregate functions
-- Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.
--Select sum(cost) from petrescue;
--Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
--Select sum(cost) as SUM_OF_COST from petrescue;
--Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
--Select max(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE;
--Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
--Select avg (COST) from PETRESCUE;
--Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
--Select avg (COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'dog';

-- Scalar and string functions
--Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
--select round(COST) from PETRESCUE;
--Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
--select length(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;
--Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
--select UCASE(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;
--Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
--select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;
--Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
--select * from PETRESCUE where LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';

-- Date and time functions
--Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
select DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'cat';
--Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where MONTH(RESCUEDATE)='05';
--Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
select SUM(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where DAY(RESCUEDATE)='14';
--Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
select (RESCUEDATE+3 DAYS) from PETRESCUE;
--Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the rescue date.
select (CURRENT_DATE- RESCUEDATE ) from PETRESCUE;
